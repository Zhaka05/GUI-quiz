# GUI Quiz Application

I engineered Quiz App that generates questions from Trivia API, and displays it with "wrong" and "right" buttons with class based Tkinter GUI library. For the project development, I learned to use OOP to optimize the codebase and to write clean code. In addition, I was able to store questions with json file format.
